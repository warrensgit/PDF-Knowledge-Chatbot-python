# PDF Knowledge Chatbot

This Repl uses [OpenAI](https://platform.openai.com/), [Pinecone](https://app.pinecone.io/), [LangChain](https://www.langchain.com/), and [PyMuPDF](https://pymupdf.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) to allow you to chat with any PDFs you upload to the training data.


## Notes
* You'll need to be a [Replit Core member](https://replit.com/pricing) to create private Repls. 
* The app will automatically add in any new PDFs you drop in when you click **Run**.
* The limit of how many chunks of knowledge you can feed to this bot depends on your Pinecone subscription. You may need to upgrade your account to give your bot more training data.
